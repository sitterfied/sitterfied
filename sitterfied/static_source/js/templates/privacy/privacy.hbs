			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>Effective as of July 20, 2013</p>
			<p>We at Sitterfied, Inc. (“Sitterfied,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) have created this privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared.  This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Sitterfied in connection with our online services (the “Services”), which are made available to you through a variety of platforms, such as through <a href="http://www.sitterfied.com">http://www.sitterfied.com</a> (the “Website”), through Facebook, Twitter, and other social media (collectively, “Social Media”), and through mobile devices (the “Mobile Devices”).  The Website, our Social Media pages, and the Mobile Devices are collectively referred to as the “Platforms.”</p>
			<p>By visiting our Website and/or using our Services on any of the Platforms, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use.    </p>
			<p>Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use.</p>
			<p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong></p>
			<p>1. Personal Information</p>
			<p>When you sign up to become a Registered User you will be required to provide us with personal information about yourself (collectively, the “Personal Information”) for your Account. It is your decision whether or not to share your Personal Information, but please bear in mind that you may not be able to make effective use of the Services if you choose not to share Personal Information.  Such Personal Information for Registered Users includes your name, e-mail address, physical address, and phone number.  </p>
			<p>If you sign up, and subsequently login into the Website, using an account from a social networking site (each a “Social Network”), we may request your permission to access your basic information on said Social Network, such as, but not limited to, your profile picture and a list of your social connections (your “Social Network Information”).  Your Social Network Information is harnessed to facilitate the registration process and to personalize and improve your interaction with the Services by, for instance connecting you with Parents or Sitters you or your social connections know and/or recommend. </p>
			<p>Additionally, we may also request certain other information from you, depending on whether you are registering as a Parent or as a Sitter. For instance, if you are a Parent, we may also ask for information such as the number of children you have and their ages. If you are a Sitter, we may also ask for information such as the number of years of applicable experience you have, the rates you charge, and your availability.</p>
			<p>We do not collect any Personal Information from you when you use the Services unless you provide us with the Personal Information voluntarily.  And, we do not sell, rent, or license any Personal Information that you provide to us.   </p>
			<p>2. Profile Information</p>
			<p>In order to use the Services as a Registered User and enter into Bookings with other Registered Users, you will need to provide certain other information for your online profile (your “Profile”), some of which may be made visible to other Registered Users and Guests (the “Profile Information”), depending on your Account settings. If you are a Parent, such Profile Information may include, without limitation, certain information about your children such as age and special needs, emergency contact information, and transportation requirements.  If you are a Sitter, such Profile Information may include, without limitation, information about the rates you charge, education, availability, special skills, and the geographic scope of your services.</p>
			<p>Depending on your Account settings, your Profile Information will be made available in search results so that your social connections can find you on the Website. Parents and Sitters can view shared connections and affiliations of other Parents and Sitters on the Website. Additionally, if a Parent and a Sitter enter into a Booking, each of them will have access to the other’s full Profiles. </p>
			<p>3. Other Information</p>
			<p>In addition to the Personal Information and Profile Information that you voluntarily provide to us, we may collect additional information (collectively, the “Other Information”).  Such Other Information may include:</p>
			<p>a. From You.  Additional information about yourself that you voluntarily provide to us, such as your gender and your service preferences.</p>
			<p>b. From Your Activity.  Information that we automatically collect when you use the Services, such as the type of Platform you’re using, your IP addresses, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of the Website you visit, and similar information concerning your use of the Services.   </p>
			<p>c. From Cookies.  Information that we collect using “cookie” technology.  Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit.  We use cookies to help us collect Other Information and to enhance your experience using the Services.  If you do not want the Platforms to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer or Mobile Device.  Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this.  However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Services may not function properly.  When the Services are made available to you through Facebook, Twitter, and/or other third-party Social Media sites, please be aware that these other sites maintain their own policies regarding cookies and the collection and use of information.  You are responsible for reviewing those policies.</p>
			<p><strong>Information Collected by or Through Third-Party Companies</strong></p>
			<p>Sitterfied also uses third party service providers (each a “Service Provider”), such as Google Analytics, that administer various services, such as web analytics and data facilitation, that may use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and web server logs to assist with analyzing how Users come upon and interact with the Website.  The information gathered through such means is disclosed to and gathered directly by these Service Providers, and any Service Provider’s use of such information is subject to the Service Provider’s privacy policies, and not Sitterfied’s Privacy Policy.  </p>
			<p><strong>Accessing and Modifying Personal Information and Communication Preferences</strong></p>
			<p>If you have registered for the Services, you may access, review, and make changes to your Personal Information, Profile Information, and Other Information (collectively, “Your Information”) by following the instructions found on the applicable Platform.  In addition, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any Sitterfied marketing email.  Registered Users cannot opt out of receiving transactional e-mails related to their account.  We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner.  You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our subscription databases.</p>
			<p><strong>How We Use and Share the Information  </strong></p>
			<p>We use Your Information to provide you the Services, solicit your feedback, inform you about our products and services, to administer our rewards and promotional programs, and to improve our Services to you.  Also, we may share Your Information as described below.</p>
			<p>In an ongoing effort to better understand our users and our Services, we might analyze Your Information in aggregate form in order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Services.  This aggregate information does not identify you personally.  We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our products and Services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
			<p>We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples may include providing marketing assistance, information technology support, and customer service.  These other companies will have access to Your Information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law. </p>
			<p>With your permission, third-party applications or services may access Your Information.  We use standard OAuth (open authorization) to enable you to give permission to share Your Information with other websites and services, such as Facebook and Twitter (e.g., when you agree to a pop-up requesting you to allow another application to access your account information).  We also use OAuth to allow us to share information about you that is stored by us without sharing your security credentials.</p>
			<p>If we or all or substantially all of our assets are acquired, we expect that the Your Information would be transferred along with the other business assets. </p>
			<p>To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose Your Information when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency, or whenever we believe that disclosing the such Information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Sitterfied or others.  </p>
			<p><strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong></p>
			<p>We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the Your Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable.  We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Platforms may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.  </p>
			<p><strong>Children </strong></p>
			<p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 through the Services.  If you are under 13, please do not give us any Personal Information.  We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide Personal Information through the Services without their permission.  If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>
			<p><strong>External Websites</strong></p>
			<p>The Website and the Services may contain links to third-party websites.  Sitterfied has no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors, or other websites to which we provide links.  As such, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those third-party websites.  You should check the applicable third-party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting any other websites. </p>
			<p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
			<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date stated at the top of this Privacy Policy.  We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post any changes on the Website as soon as they go into effect.  By accessing the Website or using the Services after we make any such changes to this Privacy Policy, you are deemed to have accepted such changes.  Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis. </p>
