			<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
			<p>Sitterfied, Inc. (“Sitterfied,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is truly excited that you have chosen to access and use the Sitterfied website (the “Website”), our Facebook, Twitter, and/or our other social media plugins (the “Social Media Plugins,” together with the Website, the “Services”).  </p>
			<p>We provide our Services to you subject to the following Terms of Use, which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you.  By browsing the public areas or by accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use and the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference (collectively, this “Agreement.”).  If you do not agree to any of these terms, then please do not use the Services or the Website.  </p>
			<p>Capitalized terms not defined in these Terms of Use shall have the meaning set forth in our Privacy Policy.</p>
			<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES</strong></p>
			<p>Sitterfied provides a hub for people looking for babysitting services, and connects them to babysitter reviews and recommendations from people they know and trust within their social networks to facilitate the search process.  Registered Users, called “Parents” in our community, can run searches for the availability of other Registered Users offering babysitter services, called “Sitters,” on certain dates and during certain timeframes, and can interview and/or book babysitting services with Sitters.  The final decision as to whether the booking (each, a “Booking”) will take place is with the Parents. </p>
			<p><strong>WAIVER AND RELEASE</strong></p>
			<p>Although you are able to find information about Sitters through our Services, we are not a party to any Booking between Parents and Sitters.  Accordingly, we shall have no liability to any party in connection with such Bookings.  We do recommend, however, that in connection with each Booking, the Parent and Sitter reduce their agreement to writing, to the extent possible.  Furthermore, Registered Users acknowledge and agree that they are solely responsible for determining their own tax reporting requirements in consultation with their own tax advisors, and Sitterfied cannot, and does not, offer tax advice to any Registered User.</p>
			<p>In addition:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We make no attempt to confirm, and do not confirm, any Registered User’s purported identity.  You are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of other Registered Users whom you may contact by means of the Services. </li>
				<li>We make no representations, offer no assurances, and do not investigate any of our Registered Users’ backgrounds, morality, character, actions, or demeanor, and you hereby acknowledge that you assume the risk of any encounter or interaction with such persons.  We encourage all Parents and Sitters to communicate directly with one another through the tools available on the Services and to review their profile pages for feedback from other Registered Users.</li>
				<li>Although we reserve the right to do so, we typically do not verify information that Registered Users submit to the Services.</li>
				<li>We do not endorse any Registered Users.   </li>
				<li>In the event that any disputes or disagreements arise between a Parent and a Sitter relating to the services provided by Sitter or payments made by or due from Parent, the Parent and the Sitter are responsible for addressing any such disputes directly with each other. Sitterfied will not be a party to any such dispute, and Sitterfied will not be obligated to take any action toward resolving the dispute.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>YOU, ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND YOUR HEIRS, NEXT OF KIN, SPOUSE, GUARDIANS, LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, EXECUTORS, ADMINISTRATORS, SUCCESSORS, AND ASSIGNS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “RELEASING PARTIES”), AGREE THAT SUCH RELEASING PARTIES SHALL NOT HAVE ANY RIGHT OR CAUSE OF ACTION, AND HEREBY FULLY, FINALLY, AND FOREVER RELEASE, DISCHARGE, AND ACQUIT SITTERFIED AND ITS PAST, CURRENT, AND FUTURE MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SUBSIDIARIES, PARENT ENTITIES, ATTORNEYS, PRINCIPALS, TRUSTEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS, SUCCESSORS, OPERATING PARTNERSHIPS, GENERAL PARTNERS, INSURERS, REINSURERS, AND ASSIGNS FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, SUITS, OBLIGATIONS, COSTS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, CLAIMS FOR SUMS OF MONEY, CONTRACTS, CONTROVERSIES, AGREEMENTS, JUDGMENTS, AND DEMANDS WHATSOEVER, RIGHTS, LIABILITIES, ACTIONS, AND CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY NATURE, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED OR UNSUSPECTED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, FIXED OR CONTINGENT, WHICH SUCH RELEASING PARTIES NOW HAVE OR MAY CLAIM TO HAVE IN THE FUTURE (COLLECTIVELY, “CLAIMS”) ARISING OUT OF, BASED UPON, ATTRIBUTABLE TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR INTERACTION WITH OTHER REGISTERED USERS, ANY BOOKING, AND YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A PARENT OR A SITTER.</p>
			<p>YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES THAT THE FOREGOING RELEASE AND DISCHARGE SHALL BE EFFECTIVE AS A BAR TO ALL CLAIMS OF WHATEVER CHARACTER, NATURE, AND KIND, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED OR UNSUSPECTED, HEREINABOVE SPECIFIED TO BE SO BARRED.  IN FURTHERANCE OF THIS INTENTION, THE RELEASING PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS AND BENEFITS CONFERRED UPON THEM BY THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 1542 OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE, WHICH STATES AS FOLLOWS:</p>
			<p>“A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”</p>
			<p><strong>ELIGIBILITY</strong></p>
